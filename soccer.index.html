        <p>Step onto the field during any Lil' Kickers class and you will find it transformed into a world created just for your child. Our well trained coaches will thrill your child with 50 minutes of highly creative, high energy and age-appropriate activities
            that serve as a great introduction to soccer, and help children master developmental milestones, appropriate for their age.</p>

        <p>Because Lil' Kickers is first and foremost a child development program our purpose is really to help children mature on all levels. Our program focuses on helping children build strong physical, intellectual and emotional skills that will help
            them be successful on and off the soccer field. We believe in teaching children in ways that suit their developmental level. So, you won't see adult-like skill drills in our classes, but you will see teaching methods specifically designed
            to create an atmosphere that is effective and fun. You will also see happy, confident and sweaty kids who are eager to learn and want to keep coming back for more.</p>

        <p>Whether your child is new to soccer or has already developed a love for the game, the progressive nature of Lil' Kickers offers a place for children at every level. Our convenient class times provide families options to accommodate multiple children
            and busy schedules.</p>

        <p>In addition to providing one of the area's only soccer programs for ages 5 and younger, Lil' Kickers also helps develop solid fundamental skills for players ages 6-9. Enroll your child today, and find out why Lil' Kickers is nationally renowned
            as well as the highest quality child development program in the country.</p>
